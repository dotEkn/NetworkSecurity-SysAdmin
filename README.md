# Network Security and System Administration Labs

This repository contains my lab reports and my complete documentation _(that I see 'okay' to post)_ for the **Network Security & System Administration** course.

The repository is structured to be modular and easy to follow, with each lab documented separately using Markdown and screenshots where appropriate.

## Repository Structure

Each lab is contained in its own folder with a dedicated README:

- [Lab 1 - Compute with Docker/Podman and VPN/CMS](Lab1/README.md)
- Lab 2 - (Coming soon)
- Lab 3 - (Coming soon)

---

## Environment

Most labs are performed using the following setup (more to be added surely):
- **Kali Linux** (WSL2)
- **Windows host system**
- Cloud Platforms (e.q., Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) when required

_Additional environments can be used in the future, they will be noted inside each Labs-folder._

## Notes

- All work is performed in controlled environments intended for educational purposes.
- No real credentials or sensitive data are included in this repository (I think).
- This repository's purpose is for the teacher to grade, and serves as my hand-in assignment.
